# Adversarial Debiasing presentation

#### Sahil Farishta

## Information
The original paper is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07593).

The Google Colab notebook provided by the authors is included here. I edited the script slightly to reproduce the analogy inference presented in the paper rather than the one they originally included in the notebook. The original notebook provided by the authors can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/ml_fairness/adversarial_debiasing.ipynb). I found that the dataset the notebook loaded in no longer existed so I found an updated version of the training corpus [here](https://github.com/mmihaltz/word2vec-GoogleNews-vectors) and the analogy dataset [here](https://github.com/nicholas-leonard/word2vec/blob/master/questions-words.txt). The results from using these data sources is slightly different than what is found in the paper but you see the same trends exhibited.
