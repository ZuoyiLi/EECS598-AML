## Information
The original paper is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11932).

I replicated the procedure presented in the paper using the source code provided by the authors and linked as a submodule within the repo. I used the precomputed models that the authors provided to helps speed up the process. The attack takes a while to run and requires you to construct a 32GB similarity matrix which requires you to use a machine with large resources to successfully reproduce the results.
